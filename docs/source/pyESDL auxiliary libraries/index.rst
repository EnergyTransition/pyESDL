Since version 23.10 pyESDL comes with some helper functions to make your life a bit easier.

At the moment the following functionality is provided:

- :doc:`EDRClient <edrclient>`: an interface to the Energy Data Repository (EDR), where ESDL based factsheets and profiles can be found.
- :doc:`Geometry/shape functions <geometry>`: makes it easier to handle geometries or shapes (originally developed for the ESDL MapEditor).
- :doc:`Profile functions <profiles>`: makes it easier to handle profile information
